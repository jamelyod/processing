# Ascii Image Converter

---------

### Overview

Take an image (defined in-code) and produces a replica
of that image but in ascii. This one is largely based on tutorials
online, rather than my own engineering skills.

### Directions for Usage

Use i and o to scale in and out of the image (only two different
levels of zoom).
