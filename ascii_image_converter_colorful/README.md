# Ascii Image Converter (Colorful)

---------

### Overview

Take an image (defined in-code) and produces a replica
of that image but in ascii, but this time with colors!
Inspired by the work of Robbie Barat, this is just a simple
addition to my [ASCII Image Converter](ascii_image_converter/README.md).

### Directions for Usage

Use i and o to scale in and out of the image (only two different
levels of zoom).
